    char_start/char_end offsets and displayed excerpts remain exact.

        it on its own words, and "Требования" exists under many projects at
        once.
      - otherwise the descriptive filename (underscores -> spaces), which is
        what PDF/TXT uploads have always used — unchanged for them, since
        they never set context_prefix.
