    # accidental copy-paste duplication) can consume most or all of that
    # budget by itself, truncating the passage away and leaving the model
    # scoring near-nothing against near-nothing. Observed effect: a 3080-char
    # repeated question pushed the correct chunk from rank 1 (pre-rerank) to
    # rank 3, with two unrelated chunks scoring higher. Capping the query
