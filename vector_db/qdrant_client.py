Qdrant Vector Database Client

Hybrid search (dense + BM25-style sparse) runs entirely server-side:
Qdrant maintains sparse-vector IDF statistics incrementally as points are
added/removed (Modifier.IDF), and RRF fusion of dense+sparse candidates
happens in a single query_points call. No client-side keyword index, no
full-corpus rebuild on upload or restart.
