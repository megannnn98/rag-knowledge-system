# relevance probability in [0, 1], not ms-marco's unbounded logit, so the
# old 3.0 would have refused EVERY query outright (no score can reach it).
# Recalibrated on local/ru_eval/calibration_pairs.json (23 RU/EN pairs
# covering ru->ru, ru->en, en->en, en->ru and relevant/partial/irrelevant):
# genuinely relevant passages scored 0.941-1.000, everything the model
# judged unrelated scored 0.000-0.017. 0.1 sits inside that empty gap with
# ~6x margin above the worst non-relevant and ~9x below the worst true
# relevant, and is deliberately the permissive end of the gap — a false
# refusal costs more here than one weak excerpt reaching the generator.
# Re-run local/ru_eval/calibrate_reranker.py after changing the reranker
# model; the English eval/run_eval.py datasets are scored on the OLD scale
# and their 3.0-era numbers are not comparable.
#
# Checked AFTER reranking, not on the raw hybrid/RRF retrieval
# score — RRF is a rank-fusion formula (Qdrant docs: reciprocal-rank sum,
# not a similarity measure) and gets further boosted by retriever.py's
# multi-query merge logic, so it was never on an interpretable 0-1 scale to
# begin with.
#
# History, for anyone reading eval/README.md: the previous value (3.0) was
# calibrated the same way on golden_dataset.json + heldout_dataset.json (220
# English cases, should-refuse topping out at 1.00 against should-answer
# bottoming out at 4.94) for ms-marco's logits. Same method, different model,

    file_hashes, folders, documents, and (PDF only — see
    get_document_page()'s TXT branch, which reads straight off disk
    instead) document_pages — in ONE transaction. Does NOT swallow
    failures: a caller that gets an exception here must treat the whole
    upload as failed and roll back Qdrant + the uploaded file, not report
    it as indexed (see upload_document/upload_batch).

    Previously file_hashes was written by a separate, earlier, best-effort
    call before document_pages even existed as a concept — if the later
    document/pages save then failed, the hash row (and the in-memory
    file_hashes entry a caller only updates *after* this function returns
    successfully) never got cleaned up. Every retry of the same file then
    hit the file_hash-seen check and got a false 409 "Already uploaded",
    even though the document, its Qdrant points, and its file on disk were
    all gone — and, if the hash row had already committed to Postgres, this
    survived an API restart too. Folding it into this same transaction
    means a failure here rolls back the hash right along with everything
    else, so the caller's Qdrant/file rollback is the only cleanup left to
    do by hand.

    Concurrency: two truly simultaneous uploads of the same file content can
    both pass the caller's in-memory `file_hash in file_hashes` check before
    either has committed — the in-memory dict only reflects committed state,
    so two in-flight requests never see each other there. Without a check
    here, ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING would let the second one's file_hashes
    insert silently no-op while its documents/document_pages inserts (keyed
    on its own distinct doc_id, not the hash) go on to commit fine — two
    separate documents indexed for identical content, with file_hashes only
