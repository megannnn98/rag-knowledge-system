"""
/upload and /upload-batch endpoints, plus the ingestion helpers only they
use. Split out of api/main.py purely to shrink that file — see the
refactor plan.

Every reference to api/main.py's shared state (UPLOAD_DIR, MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES,
MAX_BATCH_FILES, file_hashes/folders_registry/documents_registry, parser/
chunker/embedder/vector_store, LANGFUSE_ENABLED/langfuse, db_save_ingestion/
db_conn, DuplicateFileHashError, PARSERS_BY_EXT) goes through a LAZY
`import api.main as m` done INSIDE each function, at the point of use —
never a top-level `from api.main import X`. Same two reasons as api/
documents.py/api/health.py/api/query.py: `api.main` imports this module to
wire up its router (a top-level `import api.main` here would be circular),
and tests do `monkeypatch.setattr(api.main, "X", fake)` against the
`api.main` module object itself — a binding captured once at import time
elsewhere would freeze at whatever value existed then.

`_FORMAT_MAGIC_BYTES` is the one exception: nothing outside this file (and
nothing in the test suite) ever touches it, so it's defined here directly
rather than staying in api/main.py behind a lazy lookup — genuinely
self-contained, unlike everything else in this module.

Chunking, embedding, the Qdrant upsert and the Postgres commit are NOT here:
they moved to api/ingest.py when Confluence sync became a second source of
ParsedDocuments, so both sources run the same code (see that module).
MAX_CONCURRENT_INGESTIONS and the ingestion slot moved with them, since the
semaphore now has to bound uploads and syncs together rather than uploads
alone.

The backup-exclusion dependency (`Depends(require_not_backing_up)`) below
comes from `api/dependencies.py`, shared with api/documents.py — it has
zero dependency on api.main's state, so both modules import the same
implementation directly rather than each keeping their own copy.
